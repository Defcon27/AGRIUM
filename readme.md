### THE PROBLEM WE ARE AIMING TO SOLVE:
```txt
Statistical studies indicate that 66% of people will live in cities by 2050 while only a few people work in farming. There will bea 
50% increase in food demand which means that the world will have 3 billion more mouths to feed than it does today. Also, climate change has raised problems in the way we traditionally produce food by ruining hard produced crops over the past three decades. 

Technology has penetrated almost every industry but when taking a look over an agricultural field we won't be seeing drones flying or robots harvesting crops any time soon even though this is happening in the western countries. This is because an average farmer in India owns a farm of size 1.1 hectares and they can't invest huge amounts on automation technology just because it exists.
Also, farmers often end up over-irrigating the field, improper use of chemicals and pesticides resulting in poor control of weeds and many of them struggle with losing crops to pests. This also results in polluting and degrading the farming soil making it less arable for the upcoming crop grown in that land.

This situation has arisen due to poor monitoring and management of crops. They lack the necessary system that can make their practice more efficient, profitable and environmentally friendly.
```

### TECHNOLOGY STACK:
- Python
- Flask
- IoT: Raspberry Pi
- Cloud
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

### SOLUTION PROPOSED:
```txt
To tackle the above-mentioned problems we decided to make a multi-functional robot that can be remotely operated that is capable of many tasks for which we are going to use sensors to gather different data to provide monitoring and management of the farm to increase efficiency and quality of crops produced intelligently.

-> Statistical data of the farm is collected like temperature, humidity, soil images to determine the type of soil on the farm. This data can be collectively used with weather data to suggest the farmers' suitable crops to be grown in that soil.
-> The robot fetches data from crops grown in the field to determine the right amount of irrigation requires by that particular crop at the right time with the help of data fetched from the robot's sensors.
-> Using the images collected by the camera from the robot, the most efficient fertilizers, and pesticides are suggested at targeted regions for pest mitigation which helps in substantial savings and reduce overuse of chemicals on the field thus reducing the impact on the farm soil while at the same time not compromising the quality of the crop. 

Thus with this kind of robotic tech, we could enable more reliable monitoring of crops which gives farmers more control over the quality of crops along with increasing productivity, efficiently, improve yield and increase overall profitability by reducing cost which helps farmers to invest more in this kind of technology. Last but not the least controlled use of water and chemicals results in less harm to the environment.
```

### NOVELTY OF OUR SOLUTION:
- High precise monitoring at the plant level to obtain viable data.
- Provides a cost-effective way to collect data from farms to improve crop yield and optimize resource use.
- All data can be stored on the cloud so that farmers can easily manage and share details regarding their farm data.
- Easy to use
- Very Accessible
